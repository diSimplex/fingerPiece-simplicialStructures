# Finger Piece: Simplicial Structures

This finger piece collects our construction of Simplicial Structures used
in the diSimplex projects.

Fundamentally we want to explore the structure of space-time. We will do
this using simplicial structures. OR more correctly directed limits (is
this the correct (categorical) direction?) of simplicial structures, where
the "ideal" limit represents the "Newtonian/Relativistic limit".

My impression is we do *not* want the degenerate simplicies.

Christian Ruschoff (in his Lecture notes: Simplicial sets) suggests the
main reason we want the degenerate simplicies is so that we can make the
product of topological realizations equal the to the reliazation of the
product of simplicial structures. Since we are taking limits of simplicial
structures, do we care about the "classical" topological realization?

**Q** : Do we want product structure of "topologies" in our case. That is
what is the *meaning* of the product of spaces in space-time?

**Q** : An equally important question is: are the product of *topological* spaces needed for
the four-manifold and the "Whitney Trick"?

We want to use Glynn Winskel's approach to both the semantics of parallel
computation (for causal space-time) as well as his approach to symmetry
(for representation). However since simplicial structures are rather rigid
(until we get to the Newtonian/Relativistic limit), we need to define
*local* symmetries and then show that any local symmetries can be embedded
into a larger structure. This is essentially Urysohn's lemma (or collaring
of piece-wise structures).
